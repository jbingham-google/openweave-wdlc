#    Description:
#      This file effects a Weave Data Language (WDL) validator that
#      ensures that the base name for traits, interfaces, resources,
#      and typespaces are unique within that typespace.
#
#      This is required for C and Objective-C. It is also good hygiene
#      in general.

"""Checks if any objects have duplicate names.

This validator ensures that the base name for traits, ifaces, resources, and
typespaces are unique within that typespace. This is required for C and
Objective-C. It's also good hygiene in general.
